## This is the rpolars organization 👋🌈🍿

The rpolars logo is a crude modification of the free artwork made by [titgatelu](https://www.vecteezy.com/members/tigatelu):
The logo features a golden chain with a '$'-sign. The '$'-operator is the distinctive difference between py-polars/nodejs-polars to r-polars.
